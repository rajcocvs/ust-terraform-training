Terraform configuration is an excellent demonstration of conditional resource creation, environment-based instance selection, and local variable usage. Here's a breakdown and analysis of each case, followed by recommendations for best practices and improvements.

‚úÖ Highlights of the Configuration:
Provider version: Using AWS provider ~> 5.0, which ensures compatibility with the latest features.

Conditionals: Smart use of count and ternary operators to control resource provisioning.

Scenarios covered:

Simple flag-based condition (create_instance)

Environment-based provisioning logic

Multi-level conditions using locals

üîç Case-by-Case Breakdown:
‚úÖ Case 1: Boolean Toggle

variable "create_instance" {
  type    = bool
  default = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "example1" {
  count         = var.create_instance ? 1 : 0
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "ConditionalInstance"
  }
}
Purpose: Creates an instance only if create_instance is true.

Use Case: Toggle resource for testing or optional provisioning.

‚úÖ Case 2: Environment-Based Type

variable "environment" {
  default = "dev"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example2" {
  instance_type = var.environment == "prod" ? "t3.large" : "t3.micro"
}
Purpose: Chooses instance type based on environment.

Use Case: Dynamically scaling resources for different stages.

‚úÖ Case 3: Combined Condition

resource "aws_instance" "example3" {
  count = (var.create_instance && var.environment == "prod") ? 1 : 0
}
Purpose: Provisions only if both create_instance is true AND environment is prod.

‚úÖ Case 4: Locals for Clean Logic

locals {
  instance_type = (var.environment == "prod" ? "t3.large" :
                  var.environment == "staging" ? "t3.medium" :
                  "t3.micro")
}
Purpose: Clean, readable multi-level decision using locals.

Use Case: Avoids complex inline ternaries.

‚úÖ Case 5: OR Logic

resource "aws_instance" "example5" {
  count = (var.create_instance && 
          (var.environment == "prod" || var.environment == "dev")) ? 1 : 0
}
Purpose: Instance created for prod or dev environments, if allowed by create_instance.
