This Terraform configuration dynamically selects an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on the AWS region, and then launches an EC2 instance in that region.

‚úÖ variables.tf
1. Region AMIs Map

variable "region_amis" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    "us-east-1" = "ami-12345678"
    "us-west-2" = "ami-87654321"
  }
}
Explanation:

This is a map variable (map(string)) that defines a mapping between AWS regions and their respective AMI IDs.

Example:

us-east-1 ‚Üí ami-12345678

us-west-2 ‚Üí ami-87654321

2. Region Variable

variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-east-1"
}
Explanation:

This sets the default region to us-east-1 but allows it to be overridden if needed (e.g., via CLI or .tfvars).

‚úÖ main.tf
AWS Provider

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}
Explanation:

Configures the AWS provider to use the region defined in var.region.

EC2 Instance Resource

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.region_amis[var.region]
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
Explanation:

Launches an EC2 instance:

ami is selected dynamically using var.region_amis[var.region].

For example, if region = "us-east-1", it uses ami-12345678.

instance_type is set to t2.micro, which is a free-tier eligible instance.

üîÅ Execution Summary
Region is set (e.g., us-east-1).

AMI is chosen dynamically from the region_amis map.

Terraform launches an EC2 instance in that region with the selected AMI.
